# BudgetBoss

**Budgeting made benign.** BudgetBoss is a self-hosted, gamified personal finance app that makes tracking your money actually rewarding. Import bank transactions, set budgets by category, monitor savings goals, and earn XP and badges for healthy financial habits — all stored privately in your own database.

---

## What It Does

- **Multi-format Import** — Upload bank statements in CSV, OFX/QFX, or JSON format. BudgetBoss auto-detects column layouts and shows a preview before committing. Works from both the web app and mobile app.
- **Transaction Tracking** — Search, filter, edit, and categorize every transaction. Sort by date, category, amount, or account.
- **Budgets** — Set weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly spending limits per category. See real-time progress bars showing budget vs. actual spend.
- **Savings Goals** — Name a target (e.g. "Emergency Fund — $5,000"), set a deadline, and watch a progress bar fill as you save.
- **Gamification** — Earn XP for importing transactions, staying under budget, and hitting savings milestones. Level up, build streaks, and unlock badges with rarities ranging from Common to Legendary.
- **Multi-platform** — Full-featured Next.js web app plus an Expo React Native mobile companion for iOS and Android.

npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed    # Optional: load demo user + sample data
```

Demo credentials (after seeding): `alex@example.com` / `password123`

### 4. Run

```bash
npm run dev        # Dev server → http://localhost:3000
npm run build && npm start   # Production
```

### Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start dev server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm start` | Start production server |
| `npm test` | Run unit tests (Vitest) |

## API Overview

All routes require authentication (NextAuth session cookie for web, JWT bearer token for mobile).

| Method | Route | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | Create account |
| GET/POST | `/api/transactions` | List (paginated, filterable) or create transactions |
| PATCH/DELETE | `/api/transactions/[id]` | Update or delete a transaction |
| POST | `/api/transactions/import` | Import CSV, OFX/QFX, or JSON file |
| POST | `/api/transactions/import/preview` | Preview an import file without saving |
| GET/POST | `/api/budgets` | List budgets with current spend, or create |
| PATCH/DELETE | `/api/budgets/[id]` | Update or delete a budget |
| GET/POST | `/api/savings-goals` | List or create savings goals |

| GET | `/api/gamification/badges` | Get badge status |
| POST | `/api/mobile/signin` | Mobile auth (returns JWT) |

---

## Gamification System

| Action | XP Reward |
|---|---|
| Import transactions | +50 XP |
| Stay under budget (per category) | +25 XP |
| Hit a savings milestone | +100 XP |
| Earn a badge | +200 XP |

**Leveling:** XP thresholds increase each level (Level 2 at 500 XP, Level 3 at 1,500 XP, etc.).

**Streaks:** Consecutive daily activity tracked. One missed day resets the streak.

**Badges** (10+): `first_xp`, `level_5`, `level_10`, `streak_7`, `streak_30`, `streak_100`, `xp_1000`, `xp_5000`, `xp_10000` — each with a rarity tier (Common → Legendary).

## Import Formats

BudgetBoss supports three import formats accessible from the **Import** page (web) or the Settings screen (mobile). A preview step shows the first 10 transactions before any data is saved.

### CSV

Auto-detects columns from standard bank exports:

| Column | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Date | Yes | MM/DD/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, or MM-DD-YYYY |
| Description / Memo / Payee | Yes | Auto-detected |
| Amount | Yes* | Single column; negative = expense |
| Debit + Credit | Yes* | Two-column alternative |
| Category | No | Enables auto-categorization |

*Provide either Amount OR Debit+Credit columns. Compatible with: Rocket Money, Chase, Bank of America, and most standard bank CSV formats.

### OFX / QFX

Open Financial Exchange format exported from Quicken, most major US banks, and financial software. Both SGML-style (OFX 1.x) and XML-style (OFX 2.x) are supported. Simply export from your bank and upload.

### JSON

Accepts two shapes:
- **BudgetBoss export format** — an object with a `transactions` array (from the GDPR data export)
- **Plain array** — a JSON array of objects with `date`, `description`/`memo`/`payee`, and `amount` fields

### File size limit

All formats: **10 MB maximum** per upload.

---

## Privacy & Security

- All financial data stays in **your own PostgreSQL database** — nothing is sent to third parties.
- Passwords are hashed with bcryptjs; plain-text credentials are never stored.
- CSV files are processed in-memory and not written to disk.
- Web sessions use NextAuth JWT cookies; mobile uses 30-day expiring JWT bearer tokens stored in device secure storage.
